# Kantele-program
The aim of this programme is to help Kantele manufacturers in their work by making theoretical calculations and thus enabling them to dimension the strings they are going to use more easily.

# How it works ?

The program is consist of 4 parts. Calcul on Preset Kantele, Charactweristic and caculation on one string, all informations about all the strings we put in the program and a graph wich shows the length and the number of strings.

## Preset Kantele :

This part already have all the information about strings save in the program. The pitch, the number of strings et the diameter of the strings are already in the porgram. You can choose the materials of the string, the tension of the strings and if you want, put the same diameter for all the strings.

There are 4 Kantele in this program.

The fisrt one have 5 strings :
- Pitch: D4, E4, F4#, G4, A4.
- Diameter: 0.5mm, 0.45mm, 0.4mm, 0.4mm, 0.35mm.

The second one is a 11 strings Kantele :
- Pitch: A3, B3, C4#, D4, E4, F4#, G4, A4, B4, C5#, D5.
- Diameter: 0.55mm, 0.5mm, 0.45mm, 0.45mm, 0.4mm, 0.4mm, 0.35mm, 0.35mm, 0.3mm, 0.3mm, 0.3mm.

The third one is a 18 strings Kantele :
- Pitch: G3, A3, B3, C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4, C5, D5, E5, F5, G5, A5, B5, C6.
- Diameter: 0.65mm, 0.55mm, 0.5mm, 0.5mm, 0.45mm, 0.45mm, 0.4mm, 0.4mm, 0.4mm, 0.35mm, 0.35mm, 0.35mm, 0.35mm, 0.3mm, 0.3mm, 0.25mm, 0.25mm, 0.25mm, 0.25mm.

The last one is a 26 strings Kantele :
- Pitch: C3, D3, E3, F3, G3, A3, B3, C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4, C5, D5, E5, F5, G5, A5, B5, C6, D6, E6, F6, G6.
- Diameter: 0.9mm, 0.9mm, 0.75mm, 0.75mm, 0.75mm, 0.7mm, 0.7mm, 0.7mm, 0.65mm, 0.65mm, 0.65mm, 0.6mm, 0.6mm, 0.6mm, 0.55mm, 0.55mm, 0.55mm, 0.5mm, 0.5mm, 0.5mm, 0.45mm, 0.45mm, 0.45mm, 0.4mm, 0.4mm, 0.4mm.

You can choose to put the tension of the strings in Newton or choose the pourcentage of maximum tension.
When you clic on the Submit button all the informations of the strings are print in the **"Information about strings"** part and the length of the strings are display on the graph.
