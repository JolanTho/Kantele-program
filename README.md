# Kantele-program
The aim of this programme is to help Kantele manufacturers in their work by making theoretical calculations and thus enabling them to dimension the strings they are going to use more easily.

# How it works ?

The program is consist of 4 parts. Calcul on Preset Kantele, Charactweristic and caculation on one string, all informations about all the strings we put in the program and a graph wich shows the length and the number of strings.

## Preset Kantele :
